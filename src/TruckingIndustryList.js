Now, with sanctions on Moscow, Russia fuel exports to Europe are down and there is a global scramble for supply that has sent prices to record levels. When you are seeing crude rallying, you have seen diesel outpacing it just because of supply concerns. We are already at eight year lows for distillate inventories, one analyst said.</summary><description>Even before Russia invaded Ukraine, the fuel that runs the global economy was in short supply. Now some analysts say there could be spot shortages of diesel fuel and prices may stay elevated, even if oil and gasoline decline. Those higher diesel fuel prices are also stoking inflation. I have started to use the term diesel CRISIS. It clearly is a crisis that is happening before our eyes. I would not rule out lines, shortages or dollar 6 price in places beyond California, said Tom Kloza, head of global energy research at OPIS. I would npt say it is a shortage yet. Europe, I think they are headed for a shortage.A drop in demand if prices become too high could temper that outcome. The low supply of diesel fuel is the result of a loss of refining capacity worldwide, after Covid wreaked havoc on the oil industry. Kloza said it is the middle of the barrel diesel that has been hit the hardest. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, the price of oil has traded much higher, with volatile swings. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at about dollar 107 per barrel Wednesday, after trading as high as dollar 130.50 on worries about shortages due to sanctions on Russia.</description><img>fuelprice.jpg</img></Post><Post><id>2</id><author>Talia Kalpan</author><title>Trucking industry official warns 1 million truckers needed over next decade to meet demand</title><date>May 01, 2021</date><summary>Chris Spear, president and CEO of the American Trucking Associations, told Cavuto Coast to Coast on Tuesday that over the next decade more than one million truckers will have to join the industry just to maintain current economic demand.</summary><description>Spear, who is the head of the nation is leading organization representing the interests of the trucking industry, acknowledged that there is a trucker shortage and stressed that aggressive steps are needed to address the PROBLEM. Being drivers needed to deliver fuel to gas stations are in short supply, it could cause a fuel shortage, which could lead to more pain at the pump this summer. It could also lead to increased prices for other essential items. According to the National Tank Truck Carriers trade group, up to 25 percent of trucks are parked around the country because there are not enough qualified truck drivers. That number is up 15 percent from the beginning of last summer. The demand for drivers took a hit when pandemic-induced lockdowns triggered steep declines in the gasoline market, and drivers opted for other jobs. However, the return to pre-pandemic numbers has been further undermined by unemployment benefits and stimulus checks keeping people away from jumping back into the workforce. We came into the pandemic with a shortage of about 61,000 drivers. I am certain the new numbers when they come out will be a bit more inflated because of the pandemic, Spear told host Neil Cavuto, adding that as the U.S. exits the pandemic, the PROBLEM will persist. It is a long term problem that we need to do multiple things to address, he stressed. He noted that during the coronavirus pandemic truckers played a key role in transporting key items including toilet paper, milk, eggs, test kits, vaccines and face masks. So it is a very hard-working, loyal, patriotic industry and we do have a shortage, Spear said, pointing out that truckers get paid well and receive good benefits without needing a college degree. According to the American Trucking Associations latest Driver Compensation Study, the median salary for a truckload driver working a national, irregular route was over dollar 53,000, a dollar 7,000 increase from the last survey covering annual pay for 2013. Spear stressed that even with the driver shortage, the U.S. will not run out of essential items like fuel and eggs given there is plenty of supply and there is a driver that is going to make certain it gets to where it needs to be and resupplied. Spear then noted that we have tons of trucks and a lot of equipment sidelined right now because we do not have the drivers to move it. Our ability to respond to this economy and grow more quickly really does depend on having a viable talent pool, he continued, pointing out that a lot of people are retiring and we have trouble recruiting in terms of young people. We have to make a very concerted effort over the next five, ten years, to really fill those gaps if we are going to maintain pace with the economy, Spear stressed. He noted that trucks move 71 percent of the domestic freight in this country and stressed that regardless of where it is in the supply chain, at one point in time it will touch a truck and it is a driver that gets it where it needs to go.</description><img>truckdrivershortage.jpg</img></Post><Post><id>3</id><author>CNBC</author><title>Why The Trucking Industry Is So Fragmented And Chaotic</title><date>October 31, 2021</date><summary>Trucking is an especially fragmented industry, which makes it susceptible to continuous boom and bust cycles.</summary><description>Trucking is an especially fragmented industry, which makes it susceptible to continuous boom and bust cycles. While the pandemic wreaked havoc on several industries, trucking is no exception the industry as a whole is experiencing a shortage of drivers, high turnover rates, and order delays, among a slew of other problems. With 40 percent of the global economy dependent on freight and logistics, the industry issues resonate across supply chains and through other dependent industries. Trucking is a dollar 800 billion dollar industry that has proven too tough for one company to dominate. Low barriers to entry make it easy for aspirants to start companies, and competition is fierce. There are thousands of trucking companies in the United States, and the fragmentation of the market produces huge boom and bust cycles. Some companies have tried to consolidate or roll up smaller operations, but the industry is resistant to it. New technological developments, such as self driving trucks, could spur consolidation by removing one factor that keeps the industry so competitive drivers. That will not be easy companies are still perfecting the technology, and the regulatory landscape would need to be changed to accommodate these vehicles.</description><img>truckingboom.jpg</img></Post></Blogs>";
